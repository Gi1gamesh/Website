Recently I wrote a microservice that used [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview). This article will outline the process needed to write [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) tests for components that consume data from RTK Query.


Since we are writing unit tests and not integration tests we need to figure out a way to mock our APIs. If we look at the [source code](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/blob/64a30d83384d77bcbc59231fa32aa2f1acd67020/packages/toolkit/src/query/tests/buildHooks.test.tsx) for tests in
RTK Query we can see that they use [msw](https://www.npmjs.com/package/msw) to mock thier API's. We will also use this package.


## Setup

```
npm install 
npm install msw --save-dev
```
